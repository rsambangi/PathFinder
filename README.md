# PathFinder

PathFinder is a Java program made to generate the optimal route between state capitals using Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm. The application's backend uses a pre-loaded dot file to generate a graph data structure, which the user can then select two states to travel between and optionally input a range of distances. The JavaFX frontend then outputs the generated path at the click of a button.
